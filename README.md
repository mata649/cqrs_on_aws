# CQRS on AWS
This project is a demo of using CQRS and Event-Driven Architecture with DDD. Terraform and the Serverless framework have been used to handle the infrastructure and lambda function deployments. For events, we've got the Event Bus using SQS and SNS to handle the flow of information between different parts of the system.
